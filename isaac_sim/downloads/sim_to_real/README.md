# Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning Resources for RoArm-M3 Pro

This directory contains resources and examples for implementing sim-to-real transfer learning with the RoArm-M3 Pro robotic arm in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Contents

- **domain_randomization/**: Examples and utilities for implementing domain randomization techniques
- **calibration/**: Tools for calibrating simulation parameters to match the physical robot
- **system_identification/**: Methods for identifying system parameters of the physical robot

## Overview

Sim-to-real transfer learning is a technique that allows policies trained in simulation to be successfully deployed on physical robots. The key challenges addressed by these resources include:

1. **Reality Gap**: Differences between simulation and reality that can cause policies to fail when transferred
2. **Domain Randomization**: Techniques to make policies robust to variations in physical parameters
3. **System Identification**: Methods to accurately model the physical robot in simulation
4. **Calibration**: Approaches to fine-tune simulation parameters based on real-world data

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains example scripts and utilities that can be integrated into your RoArm-M3 Pro projects with Isaac Sim.
