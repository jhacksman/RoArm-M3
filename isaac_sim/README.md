# NVIDIA Isaac Sim Integration for RoArm-M3 Pro

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on integrating the RoArm-M3 Pro robotic arm with NVIDIA Isaac Sim for simulation, training, and sim-to-real transfer learning.

## Overview

[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) is a scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool powered by Omniverse. It enables the development, testing, and training of AI-based robotic systems in a physically accurate, photorealistic virtual environment before deploying them to the real world.

Integrating the RoArm-M3 Pro with Isaac Sim provides several benefits:

1. **Simulation-Based Development**: Test and refine control algorithms in a safe, virtual environment
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate large datasets for training machine learning models
3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Train models in simulation and deploy them to the physical arm
4. **Digital Twin**: Create a virtual replica of the physical arm for monitoring and control
5. **Reinforcement Learning**: Train reinforcement learning agents in simulation

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

- [Installation and Setup](./interface/installation.md): Instructions for installing and configuring Isaac Sim
- [RoArm-M3 Pro Model Creation](./interface/model_creation.md): Creating a digital twin of the RoArm-M3 Pro
- [Simulation Environment](./interface/simulation_environment.md): Setting up the simulation environment

## Hardware Requirements

NVIDIA Isaac Sim has specific hardware requirements to run effectively:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX GPU (RTX 2070 or better recommended)
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 or better
- **RAM**: 32GB or more
- **Storage**: 50GB+ SSD space
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Windows 10/11

For optimal performance when training complex models, higher specifications are recommended:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3080/3090 or RTX 4000/5000 series
- **VRAM**: 16GB+ (24GB+ recommended for complex scenes)
- **RAM**: 64GB or more

## Getting Started

To get started with Isaac Sim and the RoArm-M3 Pro:

1. Follow the [Installation and Setup](./interface/installation.md) guide
2. Create a digital twin using the [Model Creation](./interface/model_creation.md) guide
3. Set up your [Simulation Environment](./interface/simulation_environment.md)
4. Explore the [Examples](./examples/README.md) to understand basic workflows
5. Implement [Sim-to-Real Transfer](./interface/sim_to_real.md) for your specific use case

## Integration with LeRobot

This documentation also covers integration with the [LeRobot AI framework](../lerobot/README.md), allowing you to:

1. Train models in Isaac Sim
2. Deploy trained models to the physical RoArm-M3 Pro
3. Implement a complete sim-to-real learning pipeline

See the [LeRobot Integration](./interface/lerobot_integration.md) guide for details.
