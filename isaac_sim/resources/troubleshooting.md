# Troubleshooting Guide for RoArm-M3 Pro with Isaac Sim

This guide addresses common issues you might encounter when working with the RoArm-M3 Pro robotic arm in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, along with their solutions.

## Installation Issues

### Isaac Sim Installation Failures

**Issue**: Isaac Sim fails to install or crashes during installation.

**Solutions**:
- Verify your GPU driver is up to date (minimum version 525.60.13)
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least 50GB free)
- Try the container-based installation method instead of the Omniverse Launcher
- Check system compatibility with the [NVIDIA Isaac Sim system requirements](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/requirements.html)

### Python Package Conflicts

**Issue**: Python package conflicts when installing additional libraries.

**Solutions**:
- Use a dedicated conda environment for Isaac Sim
- Install packages using the Isaac Sim Python executable:
  ```bash
  cd ${ISAAC_SIM_PATH}
  ./python.sh -m pip install package_name
  ```
- Check for package compatibility with the Isaac Sim Python version (3.7)

## Simulation Issues

### Physics Instability

**Issue**: The RoArm-M3 Pro model exhibits unstable behavior in simulation, such as vibration or unexpected movements.

**Solutions**:
- Decrease the physics timestep (e.g., from 1/60s to 1/120s)
- Increase solver iteration counts:
  ```python
  physics_scene = sim_context.get_physics_context().get_scene()
  physics_scene.set_position_iteration_count(8)  # Default is 4
  physics_scene.set_velocity_iteration_count(2)  # Default is 1
  ```
- Check joint limits and ensure they match the physical arm
- Verify mass and inertia properties are realistic
- Add damping to joints:
  ```python
  for joint_idx in range(articulation.num_joints):
      articulation.set_joint_damping(joint_idx, 5.0)  # Adjust value as needed
  ```

### Model Loading Errors

**Issue**: Unable to load the RoArm-M3 Pro USD model.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the file path is correct and the USD file exists
- Check for USD file corruption by opening it in USD Composer
- Try importing the model in a new stage
- If using a custom model, validate it with the USD validator:
  ```bash
  usdchecker /path/to/roarm_m3.usd
  ```

### Rendering Issues

**Issue**: Visual artifacts or rendering problems with the RoArm-M3 Pro model.

**Solutions**:
- Update your GPU drivers to the latest version
- Reduce rendering quality settings:
  ```python
  render_product = sim_context.get_render_product()
  render_product.set_shadow_enabled(False)
  ```
- Check for material assignment issues in the USD file
- Try a different rendering mode (e.g., RTX → Path Tracing)

## Communication Issues

### Connection Failures

**Issue**: Unable to establish communication between Isaac Sim and the physical RoArm-M3 Pro.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the arm's IP address is correct (default is 192.168.4.1)
- Ensure the arm is powered on and connected to the same network
- Check for firewall or network restrictions blocking communication
- Try connecting via USB serial if WiFi is unreliable
- Test the connection with a simple HTTP request:
  ```bash
  curl http://192.168.4.1/js?json={"type":"GetStatus"}
  ```

### Command Timeouts

**Issue**: Commands to the physical arm time out or fail to execute.

**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout values in your communication code
- Reduce command frequency to avoid overwhelming the arm
- Check network stability and latency
- Verify the arm is not in an error state
- Restart the arm's controller if it becomes unresponsive

## Sim-to-Real Transfer Issues

### Reality Gap

**Issue**: Policies trained in simulation perform poorly on the physical arm.

**Solutions**:
- Implement domain randomization to make policies more robust:
  ```python
  # Randomize physical properties
  for joint_idx in range(articulation.num_joints):
      damping = articulation.get_joint_damping(joint_idx)
      # Add random variation (±20%)
      new_damping = damping * np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
      articulation.set_joint_damping(joint_idx, new_damping)
  ```
- Calibrate simulation parameters to match the physical arm (see [sim_to_real_calibration.py](../examples/sim_to_real_calibration.py))
- Add realistic noise to sensor readings in simulation
- Use progressive networks that can adapt to the real robot
- Implement adaptive control techniques that can compensate for model discrepancies

### Calibration Challenges

**Issue**: Difficulty calibrating simulation parameters to match the physical arm.

**Solutions**:
- Collect more diverse calibration data covering the arm's full range of motion
- Use more sophisticated optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization)
- Focus on calibrating the most important parameters first (mass, friction, damping)
- Consider using system identification techniques to estimate parameters directly
- Implement online adaptation to continuously refine parameters

## Performance Issues

### High VRAM Usage

**Issue**: Isaac Sim consumes too much VRAM, leading to out-of-memory errors.

**Solutions**:
- Reduce rendering quality and resolution
- Simplify the simulation environment by removing unnecessary objects
- Use model pruning and quantization for neural networks
- Implement gradient checkpointing for large models
- Monitor VRAM usage to identify the most memory-intensive components:
  ```python
  import torch
  print(f"CUDA memory allocated: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e9:.2f} GB")
  print(f"CUDA memory reserved: {torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1e9:.2f} GB")
  ```

### Slow Simulation

**Issue**: Simulation runs too slowly, especially during training.

**Solutions**:
- Reduce physics fidelity when not needed
- Disable rendering during training:
  ```python
  # Disable rendering
  sim_context.set_rendering_enabled(False)
  
  # Run training loop
  # ...
  
  # Re-enable rendering for visualization
  sim_context.set_rendering_enabled(True)
  ```
- Use headless mode for training on servers
- Implement parallel environments for faster data collection
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks:
  ```bash
  # Run with NVIDIA Nsight Systems profiling
  nsys profile -o profile_output ./python.sh your_script.py
  ```

## Integration with LeRobot

### Compatibility Issues

**Issue**: Difficulty integrating Isaac Sim with the LeRobot AI framework.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure compatible versions of both platforms
- Use standardized data formats for exchanging information
- Implement a clear API boundary between the systems
- Start with simple integration tests before attempting complex workflows
- Follow the integration guide in the [LeRobot documentation](../../lerobot/README.md)

## Hardware-Related Issues

### GPU Overheating

**Issue**: GPU overheating during extended simulation or training sessions.

**Solutions**:
- Improve system cooling
- Reduce simulation complexity
- Monitor GPU temperature:
  ```bash
  nvidia-smi -q -d TEMPERATURE
  ```
- Implement periodic cooling breaks in long training sessions
- Consider underclocking the GPU slightly for stability

### Multi-GPU Configuration

**Issue**: Challenges with distributing workloads across multiple GPUs.

**Solutions**:
- Use explicit device placement for different components:
  ```python
  # Place physics simulation on GPU 0
  with torch.cuda.device(0):
      # Physics simulation code
  
  # Place neural network training on GPU 1
  with torch.cuda.device(1):
      # Training code
  ```
- Implement proper synchronization between GPUs
- Use NVIDIA's multi-GPU best practices
- Consider using frameworks with built-in multi-GPU support
