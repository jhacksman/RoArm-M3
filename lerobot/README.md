## What is LeRobot?

LeRobot is a framework developed by Hugging Face that aims to lower the barrier to entry for robotics by providing:

1. **Pre-trained models**: Ready-to-use models for common robotic tasks
2. **Teaching datasets**: Datasets for training and fine-tuning models
3. **Simulation environments**: Virtual environments for testing and training
4. **Algorithm library**: Collection of algorithms for robotic control and learning

The framework supports various learning approaches:
- Deep Learning
- Imitation Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## RoArm-M3 Pro and LeRobot Integration

The RoArm-M3 Pro robotic arm officially supports the LeRobot AI framework, allowing developers to:

1. **Deploy pre-trained models**: Use LeRobot's pre-trained models for immediate functionality
2. **Record custom datasets**: Create custom datasets by demonstrating movements with the arm
3. **Train custom models**: Train neural networks on these datasets
4. **Deploy trained models**: Deploy the trained models back to the arm for autonomous operation

This integration enables the RoArm-M3 Pro to perform complex tasks through AI-driven control, expanding its capabilities beyond traditional programming approaches.

## Key Features of the Integration

- **Teleoperation for Dataset Creation**: Control the arm manually to record trajectories
- **Neural Network Training**: Train models on recorded datasets
- **Autonomous Operation**: Deploy trained models for autonomous control
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Test in simulation before deploying to the physical arm
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve models through iterative training
