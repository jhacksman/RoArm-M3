# AK09918C Calibration Software Information

This file serves as a placeholder for the AK09918C calibration software. The actual calibration software would be a binary executable or library that helps calibrate the AK09918C 3-axis electronic compass.

## Calibration Process

The AK09918C requires calibration for optimal performance. The calibration process typically involves:

1. Rotating the sensor in a figure-eight pattern
2. Collecting raw magnetic field data
3. Calculating hard-iron and soft-iron compensation parameters
4. Storing calibration parameters in non-volatile memory

## Calibration Parameters

The calibration software would typically adjust the following parameters:

- Hard-iron offset (X, Y, Z)
- Soft-iron transformation matrix
- Scale factors

## Usage Instructions

To use the actual calibration software:

1. Connect the RoArm-M3 Pro to your computer
2. Run the calibration software executable
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for rotating the arm
4. Wait for the calibration process to complete
5. Verify calibration accuracy by checking heading values

## Original Source

The original calibration software would typically be provided by AKM Semiconductor, the manufacturer of the AK09918C sensor.

## Notes

This placeholder file is included to document the need for calibration software. If you require the actual calibration software, please contact AKM Semiconductor or Waveshare for the appropriate software package.
