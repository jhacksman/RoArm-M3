# QMI8658 Calibration Tool Information

This file serves as a placeholder for the QMI8658 calibration tool. The actual calibration tool would be a binary executable or library that helps calibrate the QMI8658 6-axis motion sensor.

## Calibration Process

The QMI8658 requires calibration for optimal performance. The calibration process typically involves:

1. Placing the sensor in specific orientations
2. Collecting raw sensor data
3. Calculating offset and scale factors
4. Storing calibration parameters in non-volatile memory

## Calibration Parameters

The calibration tool would typically adjust the following parameters:

- Accelerometer zero offset (X, Y, Z)
- Gyroscope zero offset (X, Y, Z)
- Accelerometer scale factors
- Gyroscope scale factors
- Temperature compensation values

## Usage Instructions

To use the actual calibration tool:

1. Connect the RoArm-M3 Pro to your computer
2. Run the calibration tool executable
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for positioning the arm
4. Wait for the calibration process to complete
5. Verify calibration accuracy

## Original Source

The original calibration tool would typically be provided by QST Corporation, the manufacturer of the QMI8658 sensor.

## Notes

This placeholder file is included to document the need for a calibration tool. If you require the actual calibration software, please contact QST Corporation or Waveshare for the appropriate software package.
