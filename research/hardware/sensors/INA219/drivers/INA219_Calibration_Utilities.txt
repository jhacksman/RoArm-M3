# INA219 Calibration Utilities Information

This file serves as a placeholder for the INA219 calibration utilities. The actual calibration utilities would be software tools that help calibrate the INA219 current/voltage monitoring chip for accurate measurements.

## Calibration Process

The INA219 requires calibration for optimal performance. The calibration process typically involves:

1. Setting the calibration register with appropriate values
2. Adjusting for shunt resistor tolerance
3. Configuring the bus and shunt voltage ranges
4. Setting the conversion time and averaging

## Calibration Parameters

The calibration utilities would typically adjust the following parameters:

- Shunt resistor value (typically 0.1 ohm)
- Current LSB (least significant bit) value
- Maximum expected current
- Bus voltage range (16V or 32V)
- Shunt voltage range (±40mV, ±80mV, ±160mV, or ±320mV)
- ADC resolution and averaging

## Usage Instructions

To use the actual calibration utilities:

1. Connect the INA219 to your microcontroller
2. Run the calibration utility software
3. Configure the parameters based on your specific application
4. Write the calibration values to the INA219 registers
5. Verify calibration accuracy with known loads

## Original Source

The original calibration utilities would typically be provided by Texas Instruments or third-party developers for the INA219 chip.

## Notes

This placeholder file is included to document the need for calibration utilities. If you require the actual calibration software, please refer to Texas Instruments' documentation or third-party libraries for the INA219.
