# IPEX/U.FL Antenna Connection Guide

## Proper Connection Technique

1. **Inspection**: Ensure both the connector on the board and the antenna connector are clean and undamaged.

2. **Alignment**: Hold the antenna connector perpendicular to the board connector. The center pin of the antenna connector should align with the center receptacle of the board connector.

3. **Connection**:
   - Do not apply connection at an angle
   - Use your fingertip or a flat, non-metallic tool to press directly down
   - Apply gentle, even pressure until you feel a slight "click" or snap
   - Do not twist or rock the connector during installation

4. **Verification**: Gently tug on the cable to ensure it's securely connected. The connection should feel firm but not require excessive force to maintain.

5. **Disconnection**:
   - Use a proper U.FL removal tool if available
   - If no tool is available, carefully lift the connector straight up
   - Never pull on the cable itself
   - Do not use metal tools that could damage the connector

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Applying too much force
- Connecting at an angle
- Twisting the connector
- Pulling on the cable instead of the connector
- Using metal tools that can damage the connector
- Exceeding the rated mating cycles (typically 30)

## Antenna Selection for RoArm-M3 Pro

When selecting an external antenna for the RoArm-M3 Pro:

1. **Frequency Range**: Choose an antenna that supports 2.4GHz (and 5GHz if dual-band WiFi is needed)
2. **Gain**: 2-5 dBi is typically sufficient for most applications
3. **Cable Length**: Shorter cables (10-15cm) minimize signal loss
4. **Connector Type**: Must have IPEX/MHF/U.FL compatible connector
5. **Mounting Options**: Consider how and where the antenna will be mounted

## ESP32 Antenna Configuration

The ESP32 in the RoArm-M3 Pro may need to be configured to use the external antenna:

1. Check if the ESP32 is configured for automatic antenna selection
2. If manual selection is required, use the appropriate API calls in your firmware
3. Verify signal strength improvement after connecting the external antenna

This guide serves as a reference for properly connecting and using external antennas with the IPEX connector on the RoArm-M3 Pro.
