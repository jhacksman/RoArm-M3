IPEX/MHF/U.FL Antenna Connection:

Proper connection of an antenna to the IPEX connector involves:

1. Alignment: The antenna connector (male) should be held perpendicular to the board connector (female)
2. Connection: Gentle downward pressure should be applied until a slight "click" is felt
3. Verification: The connection should be firm but not require excessive force to maintain

Common mistakes include:
- Applying connection at an angle
- Using excessive force
- Twisting the connector during installation
- Pulling on the cable instead of the connector when disconnecting
