## Programming Considerations

When developing software for the RoArm-M3 Pro that utilizes the WiFi capabilities through the IPEX antenna connection, consider the following:

### Arduino Example (WiFi Signal Strength Monitoring)
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Initialize WiFi in Station mode
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.begin("YourSSID", "YourPassword");
  
  Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  
  Serial.println("");
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");
  Serial.print("IP address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void loop() {
  // Monitor WiFi signal strength (RSSI)
  long rssi = WiFi.RSSI();
  
  Serial.print("Signal strength (RSSI): ");
  Serial.print(rssi);
  Serial.println(" dBm");
  
  // Categorize signal strength
  if (rssi > -50) {
    Serial.println("Signal strength: Excellent");
  } else if (rssi > -60) {
    Serial.println("Signal strength: Good");
  } else if (rssi > -70) {
    Serial.println("Signal strength: Fair");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Signal strength: Poor");
  }
  
  delay(5000);
}
```

### ESP32 WiFi Access Point Example
```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <WebServer.h>

const char* ssid = "RoArm-M3-AP";
const char* password = "roboticarm123";

WebServer server(80);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Initialize WiFi in Access Point mode
  WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);
  
  IPAddress IP = WiFi.softAPIP();
  Serial.print("AP IP address: ");
  Serial.println(IP);
  
  // Set up web server routes
  server.on("/", handleRoot);
  server.begin();
  Serial.println("HTTP server started");
}

void loop() {
  server.handleClient();
}

void handleRoot() {
  String html = "<html><body>";
  html += "<h1>RoArm-M3 Pro Control Panel</h1>";
  html += "<p>WiFi Access Point active using external antenna</p>";
  html += "<p>Connected clients: " + String(WiFi.softAPgetStationNum()) + "</p>";
  html += "</body></html>";
  
  server.send(200, "text/html", html);
}
```
