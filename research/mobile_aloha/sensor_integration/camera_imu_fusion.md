# Camera-IMU Fusion for Mobile ALOHA with RoArm-M3 Pro

## Overview

This document outlines the integration strategy for fusing data from cameras and 9-axis IMUs in the proposed 4-arm Mobile ALOHA system with RoArm-M3 Pro arms. Effective sensor fusion is critical for precise manipulation, spatial awareness, and coordinated control of multiple arms.

## Sensor Configuration

### Camera System

The proposed system includes multiple cameras:

1. **Arm-Mounted Cameras**:
   - One RealSense D405 camera per arm (4 total)
   - Mounted near the end effector for manipulation view
   - Connected via USB to the central processing unit
   - Provides RGB and depth data for manipulation tasks

2. **Cart-Mounted Cameras**:
   - Belly camera for workspace view
   - Overhead camera for top-down perspective
   - Side cameras for peripheral vision
   - Connected via USB to the central processing unit

### IMU System

Each arm camera is paired with a 9-axis IMU:

1. **QMI8658 9-Axis IMUs**:
   - One IMU rigidly mounted to each camera (4 total)
   - Provides accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data
   - Connected via I2C to the ESP32 controller on each arm
   - Sampling rate of 100Hz or higher

## Fusion Challenges

### Temporal Synchronization

Cameras and IMUs operate at different sampling rates and may have variable latencies:

1. **Challenges**:
   - Cameras typically operate at 30Hz

   - Predictive filtering to compensate for known delays

### Spatial Calibration

Accurate fusion requires precise knowledge of the spatial relationship between sensors:

1. **Challenges**:
