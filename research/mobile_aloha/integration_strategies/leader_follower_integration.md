# Leader-Follower Integration for Mobile ALOHA with RoArm-M3 Pro

## Overview

This document outlines the integration strategy for implementing a 4-arm (2 leader, 2 follower) configuration with RoArm-M3 Pro arms on a Mobile ALOHA platform. The leader-follower architecture leverages the built-in capabilities of the RoArm-M3 Pro while extending them for multi-arm coordination.

## Leader-Follower Architecture

### Basic Configuration

The proposed system consists of:

1. **Leader Arms (2)**:
   - Positioned at the front of the mobile base
   - Controlled directly by the operator or autonomous system
   - Serve as the reference for follower arm movements

2. **Follower Arms (2)**:
   - Positioned at the rear of the mobile base
   - Mimic the movements of their respective leader arms
   - Operate in either angle synchronization or coordinate synchronization mode

3. **Mobile Base**:
   - ODrive-controlled differential drive system
   - Provides mobility for the entire platform
   - Requires coordination with arm movements

### Communication Architecture

The leader-follower communication architecture consists of multiple layers:

1. **Intra-Pair Communication**:
   - ESP-NOW protocol between each leader-follower pair
   - Low latency (approximately 2ms)
   - Reliable within 10-15 meter range
   - Handles direct synchronization of movements

2. **Inter-Pair Communication**:
   - ROS2-based communication between arm pairs
   - Managed by the central control system
   - Coordinates actions between different arm pairs

3. **Base-Arm Communication**:
   - ROS2 topics for coordination between mobile base and arms
   - Ensures stability during movement
   - Manages weight distribution and balance

## ESP-NOW Configuration for Leader-Follower Pairs

### Pairing Process

For each leader-follower pair:

1. **MAC Address Registration**:
   ```json
   {"T":300,"mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"}
   ```
   Where `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` is the MAC address of the follower arm.

2. **Mode Selection**:
   ```json
   {"T":301,"mode":0}  // Angle synchronization
   ```
   or
   ```json
   {"T":301,"mode":1}  // Coordinate synchronization
   ```

3. **Activation**:
   ```json
   {"T":302,"enable":1}
   ```

### Persistent Configuration

To ensure the leader-follower configuration persists across power cycles:

1. **Create Boot Mission**:
   ```json
   {"T":220,"name":"boot","intro":"boot mission"}
   ```

2. **Add Configuration Commands**:
   ```json
   {"T":222,"cmd":{"T":300,"mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"}}
   {"T":222,"cmd":{"T":301,"mode":0}}
   {"T":222,"cmd":{"T":302,"enable":1}}
   ```

3. **Save Boot Mission**:
   ```json
   {"T":223}
   ```

## Multi-Arm Coordination Strategies

### Workspace Management

For effective operation of 4 arms on a mobile platform:

1. **Workspace Partitioning**:
   - Divide the operational space into regions for each arm pair
   - Implement virtual boundaries to prevent collisions
   - Use ROS2 MoveIt for motion planning with collision detection

2. **Task Allocation**:
   - Assign complementary tasks to each arm pair
   - Front arms (leaders) for primary manipulation
   - Rear arms (followers) for supporting tasks or parallel operations

3. **Handover Operations**:
   - Define protocols for object handover between arm pairs
   - Implement synchronized movements for smooth transfers
   - Use visual feedback to verify successful handovers

### Synchronization Modes

The RoArm-M3 Pro supports two synchronization modes that can be leveraged for different tasks:

1. **Angle Synchronization (Mode 0)**:
   - Direct joint-to-joint mapping between leader and follower
   - Simpler implementation with lower computational requirements
   - Best for tasks requiring exact replication of movements
   - Example use case: Mirrored manipulation tasks

2. **Coordinate Synchronization (Mode 1)**:
   - End-effector position/orientation matching
   - More complex but allows for different arm configurations
   - Better for tasks requiring spatial coordination
   - Example use case: Collaborative object manipulation

### Failsafe Mechanisms

To ensure safe operation of the multi-arm system:

1. **Communication Monitoring**:
   - Heartbeat signals between all components
   - Automatic safe mode if communication is lost
   - Graceful degradation of capabilities

2. **Collision Prevention**:
   - Real-time collision detection using camera and IMU data
   - Emergency stop procedures for all arms
   - Safe recovery protocols after collision avoidance

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Ability to continue operation with reduced arm count
   - Dynamic reconfiguration of tasks based on available arms
   - Logging and reporting of system anomalies

## ROS2 Integration Architecture

### Node Structure

The ROS2 architecture for the 4-arm Mobile ALOHA system includes:

1. **Arm Controller Nodes**:
   - One node per arm for direct control
   - Publishes joint states and receives commands
   - Handles low-level communication with arm hardware

2. **Leader-Follower Manager Nodes**:
   - One node per leader-follower pair
   - Manages synchronization parameters
   - Monitors performance of follower tracking

3. **Mobile Base Controller Node**:
   - Interfaces with ODrive controllers
   - Manages base movement and stability
   - Coordinates with arm controllers for whole-body motion

4. **Perception Nodes**:
   - Camera processing for visual feedback
   - IMU data processing for motion tracking
   - Sensor fusion for enhanced spatial awareness

5. **Task Coordinator Node**:
   - High-level task planning and execution
   - Coordinates actions between arm pairs
   - Manages transitions between different operational modes
