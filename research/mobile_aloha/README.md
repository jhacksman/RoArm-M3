- **Control**: Whole-body teleoperation interface
- **Learning**: Imitation learning from human demonstrations
- **Cost**: Approximately $32k including onboard power and compute

The system has demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex manipulation tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and object manipulation. The Mobile ALOHA project builds upon the static ALOHA platform, adding mobility for expanded workspace and task capabilities.

## Proposed System Architecture

Our proposed system expands the Mobile ALOHA concept with:

1. **Quadruple Arm Configuration**:
   - Two leader arms (front-mounted)

   - RoArm-M3 Pro arms with 6 DoF each

2. **Enhanced Sensing**:
   - One camera per arm (4 total)
   - One 9-axis IMU per arm camera (4 total)
   - Cart-mounted cameras for workspace perception
   - Audio sensors for voice commands and environmental sounds

3. **Advanced Control**:
   - ODrive controllers for 24V DC motors
   - ESP-NOW protocol for leader-follower synchronization
   - ROS2-based coordination between arm pairs

4. **Multimodal AI Integration**:
   - Text prompt interface for task specification
   - Visual-inertial fusion for precise manipulation
   - Audio processing for voice commands
   - Multi-sensor encoder for unified representation
