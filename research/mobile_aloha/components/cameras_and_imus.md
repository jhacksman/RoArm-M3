# Cameras and IMUs for Mobile ALOHA Integration

## Overview

The integration of cameras and 9-axis IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) is critical for the proposed Mobile ALOHA system with 4 RoArm-M3 Pro arms. This document outlines the specifications, integration requirements, and implementation strategies for these sensor components.

## Camera Systems

### RealSense D405 Cameras

Based on the Mobile ALOHA project, RealSense D405 cameras are used for visual perception. For our 4-arm system, we will need:

- **Cart-mounted cameras**: For overall scene perception
- **Arm-mounted cameras**: One camera per arm for precise manipulation

#### Specifications

- **Model**: Intel RealSense D405
- **Type**: Stereo depth camera
- **Resolution**: 
  - RGB: 1280 x 720 @ 30fps
  - Depth: 640 x 480 @ 30fps
- **Field of View**: 69° × 42° (±3°)
- **Range**: 0.3m - 5m
- **Dimensions**: 90mm x 25mm x 25mm
- **Weight**: ~90g
- **Interface**: USB-C
- **Power**: USB powered (5V)
- **SDK**: Intel RealSense SDK 2.0

#### Mounting Requirements

1. **Belly Camera Mount**:
   - The Mobile ALOHA project uses a custom `rsd405_belly_cam_mount_v2.stl` design
   - This mount positions the camera for optimal viewing of the workspace
   - For our 4-arm system, we may need multiple belly cameras for complete coverage

2. **Wrist Camera Mounts**:
   - Each arm requires a camera mount near the end effector
   - The Mobile ALOHA project uses `rsd405_wrist_mount_v2.stl` design
   - These mounts must be adapted for the RoArm-M3 Pro arms

3. **Overhead Camera Mount**:
   - An overhead camera provides a top-down view of the workspace
   - The Mobile ALOHA project uses `rsd405_overhead_cam_mount_v2.stl`
   - This mount should be positioned to capture the entire workspace

## 9-Axis IMU Sensors

### QMI8658 9-Axis IMU

For the proposed system, each arm camera will be paired with a 9-axis IMU. The QMI8658 is a suitable option based on its specifications and compatibility with the RoArm-M3 Pro.

#### Specifications

- **Model**: QMI8658
- **Sensors**:
  - 3-axis accelerometer
  - 3-axis gyroscope
  - 3-axis magnetometer

- **Current Consumption**: 1.5mA (typical)
- **Dimensions**: 3mm x 3mm x 0.9mm (QFN package)
- **Temperature Range**: -40°C to +85°C

#### Integration Requirements

1. **Physical Mounting**:
   - Each IMU should be mounted directly to the camera housing
   - Rigid mounting is essential to prevent relative movement between camera and IMU
   - Calibration markers should be included for alignment verification

2. **Electrical Integration**:
   - I2C connection to the ESP32 controller on each RoArm-M3 Pro
   - Power supply from the arm's 3.3V rail
   - Shielded cables to prevent electromagnetic interference

3. **Software Integration**:
   - Driver implementation for QMI8658 on ESP32
   - Sensor fusion algorithms for combining accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data
   - Time synchronization with camera frames

## Camera-IMU Fusion

### Synchronization Requirements

For effective sensor fusion, precise synchronization between camera and IMU data is essential:

1. **Hardware Synchronization**:
   - Trigger signals between cameras and IMUs
   - Timestamp correlation for all sensor data
   - Common clock source when possible

2. **Software Synchronization**:
   - Interpolation of IMU data to camera frame timestamps
   - Buffering mechanisms for handling different data rates
   - Kalman filtering for optimal state estimation

### Calibration Procedures

1. **Camera Intrinsic Calibration**:
   - Standard checkerboard calibration for each camera
   - Distortion parameter estimation

2. **Camera-IMU Extrinsic Calibration**:
   - Determine the rigid transformation between camera and IMU frames
   - Kalibr toolbox can be used for this purpose

3. **Multi-Camera Calibration**:
   - Determine transformations between all cameras in the system
   - Essential for coordinated multi-arm manipulation

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Hardware Requirements

1. **Compute Platform**:
   - NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or equivalent
   - 64GB RAM minimum
   - CUDA-capable GPU with at least 16GB VRAM
   - NVMe SSD for high-speed data storage

2. **Networking**:
   - Gigabit Ethernet for high-bandwidth data transfer
   - Low-latency communication between components

### Software Architecture

1. **ROS2 Integration**:
   - Camera drivers: `realsense2_camera` ROS2 package
   - IMU drivers: Custom ROS2 node for QMI8658
   - Transform publishers: `tf2` for coordinate frame management
   - Visualization: `rviz2` for system monitoring

2. **Perception Pipeline**:
   - Object detection and tracking
   - Pose estimation
   - Scene understanding
   - Spatial mapping

3. **Control Integration**:
   - Visual servoing for precise manipulation
   - IMU-based motion compensation
